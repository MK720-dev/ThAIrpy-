# ThAIrpy â€“ AI and AR-Enhanced Physical Therapy Project

ThAIrpy is a research-driven project aimed at enhancing physical therapy using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR). The goal is to develop an immersive, data-driven system that assists both patients and therapists through real-time feedback, guided exercises, and smart progress tracking.

---

## Project Overview

ThAIrpy tackles key issues in physical therapy, including:
- Limited access in rural or underserved areas
- High cost of traditional therapy sessions
- Low patient adherence due to lack of engagement
- Time-consuming documentation for therapists
- Difficulty tracking patient progress
